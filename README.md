# Hey! I'm Alexis :)

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Computer Science major at Rutgers University New Brunswick, minoring in Music Technology (Class of 2027)  
ðŸ”¬ Passionate about machine learning, software engineering, and building tools that make a difference

I'm driven by a desire to create innovative solutions that address real-world problems, whether it's improving accessibility for users or making data more insightful. This summer, I interned at Kenvue (formerly Johnson & Johnson Consumer Care) as a Digital Experience Intern, where I contributed to projects that reduced bot activity by 400% and pitched cost-saving strategies that could save the company $200,000 annually.

Right now, I'm diving deeper into machine learning, systems programming, and full-stack developmentâ€”and I'm looking to bring that drive to a future internship where I can both contribute and learn.
